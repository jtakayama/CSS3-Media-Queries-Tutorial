CSS3-Media-Queries-Tutorial
===========================

Summary
-------
A repository for a web design course project. This is an Eclipse static web project.

Based on the tutorial at webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/responsive-design-with-css3-media-queries.

This has been tested with Mozilla Firefox (14.0.1) and Google Chrome (24.0.1312.68).

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Google Chrome users will need to run Chrome with the allow-file-access-from-files flag for the
scripts to work correctly.

Linux:

$ google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files

Windows:

Create a shortcut to Google Chrome's chrome.exe with this filepath:
<path-to-chrome.exe> --allow-file-access-from-files

The .html files
---------------
The /WebContent directory contains subdirectories /less, /less_css, and /css.
The files demo-step1.html, final.html, and three_column.html refer to CSS files in /css.
The file three\_column\_less\_css.html refers to files in less\_css generated by lessc. 
A less compiler is required to compile the .less files in /less to produce the
files in less\_css.

three\_column\_less\_css.html is a draft. The lessc compiled style\_three\_column\_out.css 
does not replicate style\_three\_column.css correctly at present.
